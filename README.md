A code first framework for uCommmerce
=====================================

Introduction
------------

In big projects where you have several environments it is time consuming to navigate inside uCommerce user interface to "click & point" for creating uCommerce definitions (category definitions, product definitions so forth).
This framework will help you making deployment throughout several environment easier as you only have to create your definitions as POCOs and then the framework will making sure that definitions will be created or updated.

This is still under development and is NOT ready for usages yet. Feel free to get inspired
